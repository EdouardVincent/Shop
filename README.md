My first database with SQLite3
Hello everybody,

I didn't post anything during a loooong time because I just learnt the databases with Python on Coursera with University of Michigan. So, I just begun to use SQLite3 and to familiarize me more with this language I decided to make a small python programm which write in a database the name and the email of the clients in a shop. It's not much but it's a begin ! So don't hesitate to check my programm and try to run it, I work with the last python's version, the version 3.10.1 on windows and rpi4.

Goodbye !
